### 💻 The Instruction Program - How VSDBabySoC Works

VSDBabySoC executes a **fixed instruction sequence** that demonstrates digital-analog integration:

| Step | Instruction | Register Change | Purpose |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | `ADDI r9, r0, 1` | r9 ← 1 | Decrement step for oscillation |
| 2 | `ADDI r10, r0, 43` | r10 ← 43 | Loop limit for ramp phase |
| 3 | `ADDI r11, r0, 0` | r11 ← 0 | Counter initialization |
| 4 | `ADDI r17, r0, 0` | r17 ← 0 | DAC input initialization (analog out = 0V) |
| 5-6 | **RAMP PHASE** | r11: 0→43 | Increment loop accumulating into r17 |
| 7-10 | **ACCUMULATION** | r17 += r11 | r17 reaches peak value (946) |
| 11-14 | **OSCILLATION PHASE** | r11: 43→1 | Decrement loop with ADD/SUB for oscillation |
| 15 | **FINAL STEADY** | r11 = 1 | r17 stabilizes at final value |
| 16 | `BEQ r0, r0, ...` | None | Infinite loop - design holds at steady state |

---

### 📊 Execution Timeline & Behavior

**The program creates a distinctive waveform with three phases:**

| Phase | Duration | r11 Range | r17 Behavior | Analog Output |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **RAMP** | ~43 cycles | 0 → 43 | r17 = Σ(0..42) = 903 | 0V → 0.882V |
| **PEAK** | 1 cycle | 43 | r17 reaches max = 946 | 0.925V |
| **OSCILLATION** | ~42 cycles | 43 → 1 | r17 oscillates (±r11) | 0.925V ↔ 0.882V |
| **STEADY** | ∞ | 1 | r17 holds final value | ~0.882V |

---

### 🔄 Data Flow: Code → Hardware → Analog

**Step-by-Step Execution Journey:**

```
1️⃣  Instruction Fetch
    ├─ Program counter increments
    └─ Instruction fetched from hardcoded ROM

2️⃣  Instruction Decode & Execute
    ├─ RISC-V decoder interprets instruction
    ├─ ALU performs arithmetic (ADDI, ADD, SUB, BNE)
    └─ Results stored in registers

3️⃣  Register r17 Update
    ├─ Accumulator for program output
    ├─ Holds 10-bit value (0-1023)
    └─ Changes every 1-4 clock cycles

4️⃣  DAC Conversion
    ├─ r17 read as digital input to DAC
    ├─ 10-bit value mapped to 1.024V range
    └─ Formula: V_out = (r17/1023) × 1.0V

5️⃣  Analog Output
    ├─ Continuous voltage on DAC output pin
    ├─ Follows r17 changes with analog resolution
    └─ Observable as smooth waveform in simulation
```

---

### 📐 DAC Conversion Formula

The AVSDDAC performs digital-to-analog conversion on the r17 output:

$$V_{OUT} = \frac{r_{17}}{1023} \times V_{REF}$$

where:
- **r17** = 10-bit output from RISC-V CPU (range: 0-1023)
- **V_REF** = Reference voltage = 1.0 V
- **V_OUT** = Analog output voltage (range: 0-1.0V)

**Example Calculations:**

| r17 Value | Calculation | Analog Output |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| 0 | (0/1023) × 1.0 = 0 | **0.000 V** |
| 511 | (511/1023) × 1.0 ≈ 0.5 | **0.500 V** |
| 903 | (903/1023) × 1.0 ≈ 0.882 | **0.882 V** ⬅️ Ramp value |
| 946 | (946/1023) × 1.0 ≈ 0.925 | **0.925 V** ⬅️ Peak value |
| 1023 | (1023/1023) × 1.0 = 1.0 | **1.000 V** |

*Simulation waveform showing instruction execution, r17 changes, and resulting analog output*

**Key Observations from Waveform:**
- ✅ r17 ramps linearly from 0 to 903 (ramp phase)
- ✅ r17 reaches peak of 946 (peak phase)
- ✅ r17 oscillates back down (oscillation phase)
- ✅ r17 stabilizes at final value (steady phase)
- ✅ Analog output tracks r17 changes smoothly

---

### 🎓 Design Insights: From Code to Silicon

**This simple program demonstrates:**

1. **CPU Execution Flow** → Instructions execute sequentially with proper register updates
2. **Data Movement** → Register r17 carries data from computation to output interface
3. **Digital-Analog Bridge** → DAC converts discrete register values to continuous analog signals
4. **Timing Integration** → All operations synchronized to PLL-generated clock
5. **System Integration** → CPU, PLL, and DAC operate as unified SoC


---

### 🧪 Behavioral Verification

**CPU Program Driving VSDBabySoC**:

```assembly
ADDI r9, r0, 1      # r9 = 1 (decrement step)
ADDI r10, r0, 43    # r10 = 43 (loop limit)
ADDI r11, r0, 0     # r11 = 0 (counter)
ADDI r17, r0, 0     # r17 = 0 (DAC input)
ADD r17, r17, r11   # Accumulate
... (accumulate loop)
... (oscillation loop)
BEQ r0, r0, ...     # Infinite loop
```

**RTL Simulation Result**: r17 ramps up (0→903), oscillates, then settles.

![Pre-Synth Simulation](./Images/Task2_Ravi_pre_synth_simualtion_final.png)
*Pre-synthesis waveform showing CPU program execution and DAC output response*

**Output Calculation**: For r17 = 903: $V_{OUT} = \frac{903}{1023} \times 1.0 = 0.882\text{ V}$

**Verification Complete**: The pre-synthesis simulation proved that our RTL design behaves correctly—the CPU executes instructions, updates registers, and the DAC properly converts digital values to analog outputs. This functional verification was critical before moving to synthesis.

**Transition to Synthesis**: With the design verified at the behavioral level, we converted this high-level description into actual gate-level logic using Yosys. This was where the abstract RTL transformed into concrete silicon primitives.

---

# 🔧 Part 2: From RTL to Gates {#-part-2-from-rtl-to-gates}

**Converting Behavioral Code to Hardware Logic**

The transition from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to gate-level design is where abstraction meets reality. In Part 1, we designed VSDBabySoC conceptually. We synthesized that design into standard cells—the actual logic gates that were placed and routed on the silicon. This part also includes verification that the gate-level design maintains functional equivalence with the RTL specification.

## 3️⃣ ⚙️ Step 3: Synthesis - Converting Code to Logic {#-step-3-synthesis}

### 🎯 Mission
Converted RTL design to gate-level netlist using Yosys with Sky130 standard cell mapping.

### 🏗️ Yosys Synthesis Flow

**Flow Steps**:
1. Load standard cell libraries (Yosys, AVSDDAC, AVSDPLL)
2. Read design files (RTL Verilog)
3. Elaboration and synthesis
4. Technology mapping with ABC to Sky130 cells
5. Post-processing and netlist generation

### 📊 Synthesis Results

**Synthesis Statistics**:

![Yosys Statistics](./Images/Task1_vsdbaby_stat.png)

**Standard Cell Breakdown**:

| Cell Type | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| sg13g2_o21ai_1 | 1247 |
| sg13g2_a21oi_1 | 1220 |
| sg13g2_inv_1 | 752 |
| sg13g2_nand2_1 | 300 |
| sg13g2_nor2_1 | 608 |
| *+ 15+ other types* | ~1500 |
| **Total** | **~5978 cells** |

---

**Synthesis Complete**: Yosys successfully mapped our RTL design to ~6000 Sky130 standard cells. The gate-level netlist was ready, and we needed to verify that this transformation preserved the original functionality. This was where gate-level simulation became critical.

---

### 📌 Connecting the Dots: RTL to Gates

The synthesis stage marked a critical transition:
- **Input**: Behavioral RTL code (what we wanted the circuit to do)
- **Process**: Yosys technology mapping (translate to hardware primitives)
- **Output**: Gate-level netlist (~6000 cells mapped to Sky130 library)

**Quality Gate**: Gate-level simulation (Step 4) verified that the transformation didn't change functionality. Only after this verification did we proceed to physical design.

---

## 4️⃣ ✅ Step 4: Verification - Testing Gate-Level Design {#-step-4-verification}

### 🎯 Mission
Verified gate-level correctness and timing closure after synthesis.

### 🧪 Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

**RTL vs Gate-Level Waveform Comparison**:

![Pre vs Post Synthesis](./Images/Task1_Pre_Post_simualtionCompare.png)
*Pre-synthesis RTL and post-synthesis GLS waveforms match perfectly - functional equivalence confirmed ✅*

**Verification Result**: All outputs match within extracted gate delays. Design ready for physical implementation.

### ⏱️ Static Timing Analysis (STA)

**STA Purpose**: Verify timing closure by analyzing all timing paths without simulation.

**Key STA Results**:
- ✅ Setup Slack (WNS): Positive → No violations
- ✅ Hold Slack (WHS): Positive → No violations  
- ✅ All critical paths meet timing constraints

**Static Timing Analysis Across All PVT Corners**:

![STA Analysis](./Images/sta6.png)
*Timing verification showing all paths within acceptable margins*

![STA All Metrics - PVT Corners](./Images/STA_All_Metrics.png)
*Comprehensive STA analysis across 16 PVT corners (Process, Voltage, Temperature variations)*

---

### 🧮 How STA Metrics Are Calculated

**Setup Time Slack Calculation**:
$$\text{Setup Slack} = \text{Required Time} - \text{Arrival Time}$$

- **Arrival Time**: Time when data reaches the flip-flop input after passing through combinational logic
- **Required Time**: Time when data must arrive before the clock edge
- **If Positive**: Data arrives early (safe margin for timing closure)
- **If Negative**: Data arrives late (timing violation - must be fixed)

**Hold Time Slack Calculation**:
$$\text{Hold Slack} = \text{Arrival Time} - \text{Required Time}$$

- **Measures**: How long data must remain stable AFTER clock edge
- **If Positive**: Data held long enough (no violation)
- **If Negative**: Data changes too early (hold violation)

**Worst Negative Slack (WNS)** = Most negative slack across all paths
- If WNS > 0: All paths meet timing requirements ✅
- If WNS < 0: Critical paths need optimization ❌

**Total Negative Slack (TNS)** = Sum of all negative slacks
- Lower TNS is better (fewer violations)

**PVT Corner Analysis** (16 combinations):
| Process | Voltage | Temperature |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| FF (Fast) | 1.56V-1.95V | -40°C to 100°C |
| SS (Slow) | 1.28V-1.76V | -40°C to 100°C |

✅ **Step 4 Complete**: Gate-level netlist was verified functionally and timing-wise. Transitioned to physical design.

### 🏭 OpenLANE Architecture

![OpenLANE Overview](./Images/openlane_asic.png)

**The Strive Family**:
![Strive SoCs](./Images/soc-google.png)

OpenLANE was developed for the **Strive** family featuring:
- ✅ Open PDK (SkyWater 130nm)
- ✅ Open RTL designs
- ✅ Open EDA tools
- ✅ Complete automation

### 📐 Flow Stages in Detail

#### 1️⃣ Synthesis - Code to Gates

![Code to Design](./Images/code_to_desing.png)

Standard cells have:
- 📏 Uniform height (for easy placement)
- 📐 Variable widths (based on complexity)
- 📊 Multiple models (timing, power, layout)

#### 2️⃣ Floorplanning

![Floorplan Stage](./Images/floor_planning.png)

Organize chip layout like urban planning:
- Land zoning → Core area, I/O areas
- Roads → Power distribution network
- Public services → Clock distribution

#### 3️⃣ Placement

![Placement Stage](./Images/placement.png)

Two phases:
- **Global**: Fast, approximate placement
- **Detailed**: Fine-tuned, rule-compliant placement

#### 4️⃣ Clock Tree Synthesis

![CTS Stage](./Images/cts.png)

Balanced clock distribution:
- Minimize clock skew
- Uniform latency to all flip-flops
- Multiple tree topologies (H-tree, I-tree, X-tree)

#### 5️⃣ Routing

![Routing Stage](./Images/routing.png)

Connect all signals following PDK rules:
- Multiple metal layers for routing
- Via connections between layers
- Design Rule Compliance (DRC)

#### 6️⃣ Sign-off

Comprehensive verification before fabrication:
- **DRC**: Geometry rules
- **LVS**: Physical ↔ Schematic match
- **STA**: Timing closure

**Design Ready for Physical Implementation**: Gate-level verification was complete. The design was functionally correct and timing closure was achieved. We then transformed this abstract netlist into actual physical hardware—cells placed on silicon, wires routed through metal layers. This was where physical design took over.

---

### 📌 Connecting the Dots: Gates to Physical Design

The gate-level netlist from Part 2 was still abstract—we knew what cells we needed and how they connected, but not where they went physically. Part 3 bridged this gap:

**Critical Stage**: This was where abstract logic became silicon. Every decision here affected timing, power, and area. The quality of physical design determined whether our verified RTL became a working chip.

# 🏗️ Part 3: Physical Design Journey {#️-part-3-physical-design-journey}

**From Logic Netlist to Silicon Layout**

Part 3 is where abstract logic becomes tangible silicon. The gate-level netlist from Part 2 contains all the information about what gates we need and how they're connected. Now we must physically realize this on a die, respecting timing constraints, power requirements, and manufacturing rules. This journey involves five critical stages: floorplanning to define regions, placement to position cells, clock tree synthesis to distribute the clock, routing to connect signals, and finally extraction of parasitics for accurate timing verification.

**This stage transforms the design from "what we want" into "what we build."**

## 6️⃣ 📍 Step 6: Floorplanning - Defining the Layout {#-step-6-floorplanning}

### 🎯 Mission
Set up OpenROAD and executed floorplanning + placement for VSDBabySoC.

### 🌟 What is OpenROAD?

**OpenROAD** is an **open-source, fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow** combining:
- Synthesis (Yosys)
- Floorplanning & Placement (OpenROAD)
- Clock Tree Synthesis (TritonCTS)
- Routing (TritonRoute)
- Sign-off (Magic, Netgen)

**Why OpenROAD**: OpenROAD eliminates the need for expensive commercial tools, making advanced physical design accessible. For VSDBabySoC, we used OpenROAD to automatically execute each stage of the physical design flow, implementing industry-standard algorithms for placement, routing, and timing optimization.

### 🔄 The Physical Design Flow

Each stage built on the previous one:

1. **Floorplan** → Define how much space we need and where key components go
2. **Placement** → Position each standard cell to optimize timing and congestion  
3. **CTS** → Build clock tree to distribute clock with minimal skew
4. **Routing** → Connect all signals following design rules
5. **Extraction** → Calculate actual parasitics for post-layout verification

This orchestrated flow transformed our gate-level netlist into a complete, routable design ready for silicon fabrication.

#### **Timing Optimization Scripts (Week 6)**

| Script | Purpose | Language | Details |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| **find_best_syth_conf.tcl** | Synthesis parameter sweep for WNS/TNS optimization | TCL/OpenLane | Iteratively tests high-impact synthesis parameters: strategies (DELAY 0-3), sizing (0-1), buffering (0-1), fanout (3-5), max transition (0.5-1.5ns), driving cells, and capacitive loads. Generates CSV with metrics for each configuration |
| **best_cell_upgarde.tcl** | Critical path cell upsizing for timing closure | TCL/OpenSTA | Analyzes critical paths, identifies bottleneck cells, upsizes cells (e.g., sky130_fd_sc_hd__mux4_1 → larger version) to reduce delay, reports WNS/TNS improvements after each upsizing |

#### **Post-Layout STA Analysis Scripts (Week 8)**

| Script | Purpose | Stages Analyzed | Details |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **sta_vsdbabysoc_synth.tcl** | Post-synthesis STA across 16 PVT corners | Synthesis | Analyzes gate-level netlist without routing parasitics; tests: FF (Fast-Fast), SS (Slow-Slow), TT (Typical-Typical) at temperatures -40°C to +100°C and voltages 1.28V-1.95V |
| **sta_vsdbabysoc_placement.tcl** | Post-placement STA analysis | Placement | Evaluates timing after standard cell placement with estimated routing capacitances; identifies timing slack degradation from wire estimates |
| **sta_vsdbabysoc_cts.tcl** | Post-CTS STA with clock tree | Clock Tree Synthesis | Analyzes balanced clock distribution; measures clock skew (<50 ps target), buffer delays, and setup/hold slack after CTS insertion |
| **sta_vsdbabysoc_route.tcl** | Post-route STA with extracted parasitics | Routing | **Most accurate analysis**: uses SPEF-extracted parasitics from actual routing; validates timing closure with real wire resistances and capacitances; final sign-off verification |
