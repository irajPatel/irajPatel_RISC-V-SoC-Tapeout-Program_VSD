Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!  
This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.  

"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India‚Äôs largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation‚Äôs semiconductor ecosystem

## üìÖ Week 0 ‚Äî Setup & Tools

| Task | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [**Task 0**](Week0/Task0/README.md) | üõ†Ô∏è [Tools Installation](Week0/Task0/README.md) ‚Äî Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **gtkWave** | ‚úÖ Done |



### üåü Key Learnings from Week 0
- Installed and verified **open-source EDA tools** successfully.  
- Learned about **basic environment setup** for RTL design and synthesis.  
- Prepared the system for upcoming **RTL ‚Üí GDSII flow experiments**.



## üìÖ Week 1 ‚Äî RTL Synthesis & Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

| Task       | Description                                                                 | Status |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| [**Task 1**](Week1/README.md#-task-1--rtl-synthesis-mux-example) | üîß MUX synthesis in Yosys, Sky130 mapping, GLS netlist generation         | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 2**](Week1/README.md#-task-2--constant-dff-mapping--gls) | üéØ Constant DFF mapping (`const4.v`, `const5.v`) + GLS validation          | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 3**](Week1/README.md#-task-3--mux-using-for-generate) | üíª MUX using `for-generate`, RTL vs GLS verification                       | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 4**](Week1/README.md#-task-4--demux-using-generate) | üíª DEMUX using `generate`, RTL vs GLS verification                         | ‚úÖ Done |
| [**Task 5**](Week1/README.md#-task-5--ripple-carry-adder-rca) | ‚ûï Ripple Carry Adder synthesis & GLS validation                           | ‚úÖ Done |




### üåü Key Learnings from Week 1

* Learned **Yosys synthesis flow**, RTL vs GLS verification, and scalable Verilog constructs.
* Synthesized arithmetic circuits and optimized designs using ABC and Icarus Verilog with GTKWave.
* [**Solved synthesis error:**](Week1/README.md#error-challenge) Fixed a missing latch mapping by instantiating a similar **SkyWater primitive**, enabling successful simulation.
* [**Applied knowledge:**](Week1/project.md) designed a Verilog Moving Average Filter, synthesized with Yosys, and verified via GLS.
* [**Future work:**](Week1/project.md##-Future-Work) Extend filter designs to higher orders and implement real-time signal processing on FPGA.

Here‚Äôs your updated **Week 1 Key Learnings** section with the additional line for the synthesis error fix, including a Markdown link to your Week1 README error challenge:

I can also **make the error line more eye-catching with emojis** to match your other sections if you want. Do you want me to do that?
